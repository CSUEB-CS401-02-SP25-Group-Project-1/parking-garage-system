## Overview
This design document aims to eliminate any ambiguity surrounding the implementation of the Parking Garage System (PGS). It reiterates the original problem description, outlines the system's goals and non-goals based on the requirements and scope defined in the [Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document](SRS.md), and provides a clear breakdown of how each class and module should be implemented in Java. To support this, the document includes detailed design diagrams for visual reference and a project timeline with milestones to ensure a smooth and organized implementation cycle.
## Context
We are developing a graphical parking garage management system in Java that enables employees to monitor garage metrics, such as the current vehicle count, generate usage reports, and print tickets and receipts for customers. Customers also have the option to self-park via a separate graphical user interface (GUI) integrated into the system.

The system allows employees to configure fixed rate fees (by the hour) for individual garages and manually override a customer's final fee for when they are exiting the garage. Each customer's ticket is represented by the vehicle they park in the garage. Employees access their interface by logging in with a valid username and password.

The system handles network communication between the user (customers and employees alike) and their garage via TCP/IP through a threaded server capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously.

## Goals & Non-goals
### Goals
Upon successful implementation of the Parking Garage System (PGS), the following goals will be achieved:
- **Employees** will be able to:
    - Log in to their GUI dashboard using their credentials (username and password).
    - View real-time statistics and activity logs for their assigned garage.
    - Generate usage reports detailing metrics such as revenue earned, vehicle count, and peak usage times.
    - Manage garage settings including adjusting the garage's hourly rate fee.
    - Print parking tickets and payment receipts for customers.
Manually override a customer's final parking fee when necessary.
- **Customers** will be able to:
    - Self-park using a user-friendly graphical interface.
    - View the current availability of parking spaces in their selected garage.
    - Receive a unique ticket upon entry and make a payment upon exit.
    - Obtain a printed receipt after completing their payment.
- **All users** will be able to interact with the system in a clear and efficient manner:
    - The system will display relevant error messages to guide users when issues occur.
    - It will handle errors gracefully to minimize user disruption.
    - It will support concurrent interactions through multithreading, allowing multiple users to use the system simultaneously without delay.
### Non-goals
- The system will not interact with or manage any external hardware or sensors such as air conditioning or surveillance systems.
- The system will not use encryption to secure transmitted messages over the network as encryption is explicitly prohibited by the project constraints.
- The system will not hash or encrypt user credentials; all credentials will be stored in plaintext.
- The system will not use standard data serialization formats like JSON or XML. Instead, a custom, human-readable format will be implemented for saving data to file.
- The system will not use any third-party databases, libraries, or frameworks. Only Java's built-in standard libraries will be used and all core functionality must be implemented from scratch by us (the development team).
## Implementation Details
### Customer Class
- Not to be confused with the Customer GUI, this class does not handle input directly, but instead processes authenticated actions sent over the network via `Message` packets
- The `Customer` class does not handle outgoing messages directly; instead, the `Server` calls its methods and returns the result to the Customer GUI as a `Message` packet over the network
- Inherits from the `User` class and, thus, becomes associated with a specific `Garage` upon initialization
- Customers do not have a unique user ID; the system uses ticket-based identification since actions like valet parking or shared ticket use are possible
- The `Customer` class is designed to facilitate and validate customer actions, such as parking, paying, and checking space availability
- Upon receiving a valid ticket ID, the system binds the ticket to the current `Customer` object, allowing further actions like payment
- Has a method to request a new ticket, which returns the ticket's string ID if the garage has space available
- Provides a method to check the number of available spaces in the customer's assigned garage (returns an integer)
- Handles the payment process for the customer when exiting the garage, validating the ticket and updating its status and fee if appropriate
- A `Customer` object can also be used indirectly by an employee to represent a customer during assisted check-in/checkout, particularly in non-self-service cases
- Includes a method to generate a receipt summary once a ticket is paid, which is returned to the GUI as a message
### Ticket Class
- Represents both the customer's physical parking ticket and their currently-parked vehicle in the garage
- Is associated with a garage upon creation
- A ticket is created when a customer successfully parks their vehicle, either through self-parking or when an employee provides a ticket
- Tickets are not created if their associated garage is full
- Upon creation, `entryTime` is set to the current time
- When the customer is checking out, `exitTime` is set to the current time
- The system calculates the parking fee by multiplying the garage's fixed hourly rate by the total parking duration (`exitTime - entryTime`)
- If an employee manually overrides the fee, the `isOverridden` flag is set to `true`, which prevents the system from recalculating the fee automatically afterward
- Each ticket has a status that reflects its current phase in the parking lifecycle [**(see "TicketStatus Enum")**](#ticketstatus-enum)
- Once a ticket reaches the `Paid` status, it becomes invalid (unable to be reused or modified)
- Each ticket has a unique string ID (e.g., “TI0”, “TI1”), generated from a system-wide counter (`count`)
- Tickets can be searched by ID within a garage's record, useful for:
    - Returning customers attempting to leave
    - Employees needing to look up and manage specific tickets
### TicketStatus Enum
- `Parking`: The vehicle has entered and is parked
- `Leaving`: The vehicle is about to leave, payment is being processed
- `Paid`: The payment has been completed
### Garage Class
- Represents a physical parking garage in the system
- Aggregates all tickets associated with the garage (vehicles currently parked)
- Maintains a list of active tickets, which allows the system to:
    - Track current occupancy
    - Look up tickets by their string ID (e.g., for returning customers or employees)
- A new ticket cannot be created if the garage is full (e.g., the number of active tickets equals the garage's capacity)
- The garage can report its number of available spaces using the formula: `capacity - ticketList.size()`
- Provides a method to check if the garage is currently full, returning a boolean value of the condition `capacity == ticketList.size()`
- Each garage has a unique string ID (e.g., "GA0", "GA1") generated at creation
- Garage instances are initialized with a fixed capacity, hourly rate, and garage name (separate from their ID)
- A garage's name can be renamed after initialization
- Stores a configurable hourly parking rate, which can be updated by an employee
- Tracks total revenue earned by the garage across all paid tickets
- When a new ticket is generated (and space is available), it is added to the garage's ticket list
- When a ticket is paid:
    - It gets removed from the garage's ticket list
    - Its fee gets added to the garage's total revenue
- Garage keeps track of its total revenue earned over the last hour, day, week, month, and year
- Garage stores its peak hour of usage (based on the highest revenue earned during any given hour)
